Article 4: Termination of the criminal action
A criminal action shall be terminated : 1    upon death of the offender;

3    if amnesty is granted; 4    if  a law is repealed;
5    if a judgment in such action has become final. 																				
																				
 The criminal action may also be terminated:

2   in   case   of   withdrawal   of   a   claim   if provided for by law.
Article  5:  Prescriptive  period  of  a  criminal action
Except  the  crime  of  genocide,  crimes  against humanity and  war  crimes  which  are  not  subject to   prescription,   a   criminal   action   for   other offenses shall lapse after:

 As  to  instantaneous  offences,  the  prescriptive period of a criminal action shall run from date of the commission of the offence.
As   to   continuous   offences,   the   prescriptive period  of  a  criminal  action  shall  run  from  the date of the cessation of the last act of the offence.
As  to  several  acts  intended  to  fulfil  the  same criminal   intent,   the   prescriptive   period   of   a criminal action shall run from the commission of the last act intended to fulfil the intent.
Article   7:   Interruption   of   the   prescriptive period of  a criminal action
The prescriptive period of a criminal action shall be  interrupted   by  conducting  investigation  or prosecution within the period provided for under Article 5 of this Law.

The same shall apply to the persons named in the complaint  but  who  have  not  been  subject  to
investigation or any other form of prosecution. 																				
																				
 Article   8:   Grounds   for   suspension   of   the prescriptive period of a criminal action
The prescriptive period of a criminal action shall be     suspended     whenever     investigation     or prosecution    is    precluded    by    an    inevitable obstacle  arising  from the  law  or  by an  event  of force majeure.
When    such    an    obstacle    is    removed,    the prescriptive  period  which  was  suspended  shall continue to run from the removal of the obstacle.
Section 2: Civil action
Article 9: Definition of a civil action
A   civil   action   is   an   action   filed   to   seek compensation    for    damages    caused    by    the offence.
Such  an  action  shall  be  solely aimed  at  seeking civil damages.
It  shall  be  instituted  as  provided  for  under  this Law.
Article 10: A person entitled to institute a civil action
Any person aggrieved by an offence can institute a  civil  action.  Such  person  may  be  natural  or legal  person,  whether  public  or  private  or  any
other person authorised by law. 																				
																				
																				
 However, legally constituted  associations  whose mission is to protect victims of violence may act on behalf of the victim to institute a civil action and seek compensation for damages arising from the acts  committed if the victim is unable to do so.
Article11:   A   person   against   whom   a   civil action is instituted
A   civil   action   may  be   instituted   against   the principal       offender,       his/her       co-offender, accomplice and person with civil liability.

If  a  civil  action  is  instituted  before  a  criminal court, the court may, on its own motion or upon application  by  either  party,  separate  the  civil
action  from  the  criminal  action  when  the  civil 																				
																				
 action  may  impede  or  delay  the  hearing  of  the criminal action.
The court  order  separating the  civil action  from the criminal action may be subject to appeal.
However,  separating  the  civil  action  from  the criminal action shall not be allowed on appeal if it was not done at the first instance.
Article 14: Suspension of proceedings in   civil action
Proceedings  in  civil  action  shall  be  suspended until the criminal case is finally adjudicated if the criminal  action  was  instituted  before  or  in  the course  of  civil  proceedings  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of  the  Organic  Law  determining the organisation, functioning and competence of courts.
Article 15: Prescriptive period of a civil action
A  civil  action  arising  from  a  criminal  offence shall  be  subject  to  a  prescriptive  period  of  five
(5) years from the date of the commission of the offence.
However,  if  the  prescriptive  period  of  a  civil action expires before that of the criminal action,
the  civil  action  shall  be  subject  to  the  same prescriptive period as the criminal action. 																				
																				
 Article 16: Failure to file a civil action
A   civil   action   cannot   be   instituted   before   a criminal  court  if  the  prescriptive  period  of  the criminal action has expired.
However,   when   a   civil   action   was   instituted before a criminal court, the court may continue to hear    such    a    civil    case    even    though    the prescriptive  period  of  the  criminal  action  has expired,   the   accused   died   or   amnesty   was granted.
Article 17: Waiver of a civil action
The  waiver  of  a  civil  action  shall  not  entail  the termination of prosecution.

The  Prosecutor  may  at  any  time  impose  on  the suspect   new   judicial   supervision   obligations, remove all or part of the obligations imposed on him/her,     change     any     part     of     them     or

Section 3: Provisional detention
Sub-section   One:   Grounds   for   provisional detention
Article  96:  Serious  grounds  for  suspecting  a person of an offence
A  suspect  shall  not  be  subject  to  provisional detention  unless  there  are  serious  grounds  for suspecting him/her of an offence and the offense alleged   against   him/her   is   punishable   with imprisonment of at least two (2) years.
Article  97:  Definition  of  serious  grounds  for suspecting a person of an offence
In  this  Law,  serious  grounds  for  suspecting  a person  of  an  offense  shall  not  be  considered
evidence  but  rather  as  plausible   investigation 																				
																				
 facts leading to the suspicion that the suspect has committed an offence.
Article   98:   Other   grounds   for   provisional detention
A    suspect    may   be    subject    to    provisional detention   if   there   are   serious   grounds   for suspecting that he/she has committed an offence even  if  the  alleged  offense  is  punishable  with imprisonment of less than two (2) years but more than three (3) months, if :
1    there is reason to believe that he/she may evade justice;
2    his/her identity is unknown or doubtful;
3    there    are    serious     and    exceptional circumstances   that   require   provisional detention in the interests of public safety;
4    the provisional detention is the only way to prevent the suspect from disposing of evidence     or     exerting     pressure     on witnesses     and     victims     or     prevent collusion  between  the  suspect  and  their accomplices;
5    such detention is the only way to protect the  accused,  to  ensure  that  the  accused 																				
																				
 appears before judicial organs whenever required  or  to  prevent  the  offence  from continuing or reoccurring;
6    given  the  serious  nature  of  the  offence, circumstances    under    which    it    was committed and the level of harm caused, the offense led to exceptional unrest and disruption  of  public  order    which  can only be ended by provisional detention.
Article    99:    Provisional    detention    by    a Prosecutor
If all the conditions of provisional detention are met,  a  Prosecutor  may,  after  interrogating  the suspect  with  or  without  his/her  legal  counsel, hold the suspect in provisional detention and take him/her  to  the  court  that  is  nearest  to  the  place where he/she was arrested with the exception of the High Court, the Military High Court and the Supreme Court.
If the suspect is a minor, he/she must necessarily be accompanied by a legal counsel. The suspect shall be brought before the judge within five (5) days  of  the  issue  of  the  provisional  detention warrant. 																				
																				
 Sub-section 2: Provisional detention hearing
Article   100:   Duties   of   the   judge   during provisional  detention hearing
A  judge  ruling  on  provisional  detention  shall have the following duties:
1    to  see  whether  he/she  is  competent  to hear    the    provisional    detention    case brought before him/her;
2    to  verify  the  legality  of  the  provisional detention warrant;
3    to examine whether there are no grounds for the termination or prescription of the criminal    action    which    would    have prevented  the  issue  of  the  provisional detention warrant;
4    to   examine   whether   there   are   serious grounds  justifying  provisional  detention of the accused.
However, the judge shall in no way reclassify the offence alleged against the accused. 																				
																				
 Article 101: Decision on provisional detention
The  judge  ruling  on  provisional  detention  shall deliver a decision within seventy two (72) hours of the bringing of the case before the court after hearing  the  Public  Prosecution  and  the  suspect assisted by a legal counsel if he/she so wishes.
If the suspect is a minor aged between 14 and 18 years,  he/she  must  necessarily  be  accompanied by a legal counsel.
Submissions and defences of the suspect shall be recorded in writing. The judge shall immediately read the decision to the suspect or notify him/her of the decision through competent authorities.
Article  102:  Nature  of   provisional  detention order
A provisional detention order is an order signed by a judge and countersigned by a court registrar when, after the hearing, he/she considers that the suspect   must   remain   in   provisional   detention following the existence of substantial grounds for suspecting him/her of an offence.
The    hearing    and     pronouncement     of    the judgement shall be public. The judge may order that  the  hearing  be  conducted  in  camera  upon
request by the Public Prosecution or the suspect. 																				
																				
 Article   103:   Justification   for   a   provisional detention order
The   provisional   detention   order   against   the suspect shall in any case be reasoned using facts and legal considerations and particularly specify substantial grounds for suspecting the accused of the offence.
Article 104: Period of validity of a provisional detention order
The provisional detention order against a suspect shall  be  valid  for  one  (1)  month  including  the date  on  which  it  is  rendered.  After  the  expiry date, it may be renewed for one (1) month on a continuing basis.
However,     the     one-month     period     of     the provisional  detention  order  for  petty  offenses shall  not  be  renewed.  For  misdemeanours,  the period of validity shall not be renewed after six
(6) months of detention of the suspect  and after one  (1)   year   for   felonies.   If   the   time  limits provided for under this Paragraph expires before the case file is forwarded to the court, the suspect under   provisional   detention   shall   be   granted interim release.
A  court  order  renewing  provisional  detention shall   be   rendered   by   the   court   under   the conditions  and  within  the  time  limits  provided
for under Article 101 of this Law. 																				
																				
 A   court   order   for   provisional   detention   or renewal  of  the  provisional  detention  must  be reasoned.
A   court   order   for  release  or  renewal   of  the provisional  detention  shall  be  rendered  by  the judge who is nearest to the place of detention of the  suspect  after  consideration  of  the  grounds which led the first judge to order detention.
Provisional detention may also be ordered when the     suspect     wilfully     breaches     obligations imposed on him/her by the court.
CHAPTER  IV:  PROVISIONAL  RELEASE AND  BAIL
Article 105: Applying for provisional  release
For   any   offence,   a   suspect   or   his/her   legal counsel   may,   depending  on  the  stage  of  the proceedings, ask the Prosecutor handling the case or the judge to grant him/her provisional release.
The    Public    Prosecution    shall    examine    the application  for  provisional  release  if  it  is  still investigating  the  case.  If  the  case  file  has  been already  submitted  to  the  Court  whether  at  the stage  of  provisional  detention  hearing  or  at  the
stage  of  hearing  on  the  merits,  the  application shall be examined by the Court. 																				
																				
 The  judge  shall  rule  on  the  application  within five  (5)  days  and  shall  be  required  to  provide reasons for the decision. If an objection is raised as  to  provisional  release,  the  judge  hearing  the case   on   the   merits   must   first   examine   the objection.
If the  provisional  release is  granted,  the  suspect may be subject to judicial supervision.
When   during   the   examination   of   an   action against    provisional    detention    of    a    person suspected  of  a  felony  the  judge  finds  that  the provisional detention is unlawful, he/she shall in spite of such illegality order  continuation of the detention   of   the   suspect   if   there   are   serious grounds   for   suspecting   that   the   person   has committed   the   offense,   and   the   person   who illegally  detains  the  suspect  shall  be  personally prosecuted.
Article 106: Grounds for provisional detention or provisional release of the suspect
If the judge finds that  there are  serious  grounds for  suspecting  the  person  of  an  offence,  he/she may order provisional detention of the suspect in accordance with the provisions of Articles 96 and 98 of this Law.
If   the   judge   finds   that   there   are   no   serious grounds  for  provisional  detention,  the  suspect 																				
																				
 shall be immediately released.
Article    107:       Being    subject    to    judicial supervision
The  judge  may  not  order  provisional  detention against the suspect but subject him/her to judicial supervision  in  case  of  offences  punishable  with imprisonment not exceeding five (5) years.
The judge may impose on the suspect obligations including the following:
1    to  reside in territorial jurisdiction  of the Prosecutor    in    charge    of    case    file preparation;
2    to   refrain   from   travelling     beyond   a prescribed        area        without        prior authorization of the Prosecutor in charge of    case    file    preparation    or    his/her representative;
3    to refrain from travelling to a prescribed area  or  being  found  in  such  area  at  a given time;
4    to report on a prescribed periodic basis to the   Prosecutor   in  charge   of  case  file preparation or a civil servant or any other officer designated by the judge;
5    to  report  to  the  Prosecutor  in  charge  of case file preparation or to the judge when
required to do so; 																				
																				
 6    to post bail;
7    to confiscate identification papers of the suspect.
The  order  of  the  judge  shall  indicate  special grounds  for  deciding  provisional  release  of  the suspect.
The  Public  Prosecution  shall  verify  observance of   the   imposed   obligations   and   apply   for provisional  detention  of  the  suspect  if  it  finds that such obligations are violated.
A  person  shall  not  be  ordered  to  report  to  a designated officer for a period exceeding one (1) year   for   felonies   and   six   (6)   months   for misdemeanours.
For  the  purposes  of  proper  enforcement  of  the obligations  provided  under  Paragraph  2  of  this Article,  the  court  order  of  provisional  release may also stipulate that the suspect is required to comply with only one of such obligations.
The judge may at  any time  upon request by the Prosecutor  or  the   suspect  granted   provisional release modify the obligations imposed to adjust them  to  new  circumstances.  If  necessary,  the judge    may,    due    to    the    new    and    serious
circumstances,    also    revoke    the    provisional release of the suspect. 																				
																				
 Article 108: Bail
The  judge  ruling  on  provisional  detention  may release  the  suspect  on  bail  only  or  on  bail  in combination   with   one   or   more   obligations provided for under Article 107 of this Law.
Such bail guarantees that the suspect will appear before  the  court,  pay  damages  arising  from  the offence, provide restitution of   property and pay fines and courts fees, if found guilty.
Article 109: Types of bail
Bail  may  be  in  the  form  of  cash  or  a  person standing as surety.
A person who accepts to stand as surety must be a person of integrity and capable to pay.
If the suspect escapes justice, the person standing as surety shall  make reparation for the  damages caused by the offence.
Article 110: Determination of bail
The judge shall determine the amount of bail in consideration   of   the   damages   caused   by   the offense.

 property damaged.
No bail  shall  be accepted in respect of offences punishable with imprisonment of more than five
(5) years.
Article 111: Bail refund
If the accused is found innocent, he/she shall get his/her bail refunded.
If  the  accused  loses  the  case,  the  court  shall decide on the use of the bail in accordance with the provisions of Article 108 of this Law.

 notified  with  the  judgment,  he/she  may  file  an opposition    within    ten    (10)    days    after    the judgment is served upon him/her personally.
If  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  judgment  was notified    on    the    person    tried    in    absentia personally,  he/she  may  file  an  opposition  until the   expiry   of   the   limitation   period   for   the enforcement    of    the    penalty   and    until    the execution   of   the   judgement   in   case   of   civil claims.

Article 172: Non- appearance of a person who files an opposition
If a person who files an opposition again fails to appear, such opposition shall become null. Such a  person  shall  neither  file  a  new  opposition  nor file an opposition to a judgment  rendered on an opposition.
A person who files an opposition must appear in person,  if  he/she  was  ordered  to  do  so  in  the judgment  rendered  in  absentia  or  the  judgment rendered  in   absentia   ordered   his/her   personal appearance as a condition for admissibility of an

However,    the    court    having    rendered    the judgment  in  the  absence  of  the  accused  may order immediate arrest of the person found guilty even though he/she may file an opposition.
The court may also order immediate arrest of the person  found  guilty  when  there  are  serious  and exceptional  reasons  given  to  the  court  having
rendered  the  judgment  in  the  absence  of  the accused. 																				
																				
 Article  174:  Effects  of  the   admissibility  of opposition   filed   by   an   accused   tried   in absentia
If  an  opposition  filed  by  the  accused  tried  in absentia  becomes  admissible,  the  judgement  in absentia shall be revoked and the court retries the case in its entirety.
In any case, any court fees incurred as a result of an  opposition including  the  costs  of acquiring a copy of the judgment in absentia and its service shall be borne by the person filing an opposition if   reasons   for   his/her   failure   to   appear   are attributable to him/her.

If the person sentenced as a result of miscarriage of  justice  is  dead,  the  right  to  apply  for  moral damages shall devolve under the same conditions upon his/her heirs.
